# conventions used throughout the language package.
# TODO : split rules in categories. (i.e. Modules / General / Structure / ...)

1 - The main language is english.
2 - Modules must be named using snake case (no capital letters & underscore separator).
3 - Every function/method should have a docstring.
4 - Every sentence (comments/documentation/...) must end with a dot.
5 - Prefer code that can be analyzed easily by the tools in place.
5.1 - But create a to-do annotation containing a more readable/optimized code for further upgrades.
6 - Scoping is important at all levels (Package/Module/Functions), put together things that do/represent similar things.
7 - Typing is required as much as possible.
8 - Constants must be named in 'Screaming Snake Case' [1].
9 - Follow as much as possible/known the PEP-8 style guide [2].
10 - Apply the Single Responsibility Principle [3].
11 - Apply a strategy of micro-commit as much as possible.
# TODO : specify precisely the canonical form.
12 - Write you code in canonical form (Ctrl+Alt+L & Ctrl+Alt+O on PyCharm).
13 - Be a Grammar Nazi, as things are already complicated enough.
